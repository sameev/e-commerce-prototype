# e-commerce-prototype

An e-commerce page set up for [Onyx Coffee](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/). If you enjoy coffee, I recommend checking them out. My favorite is the [Tropical Weather](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/tropical-weather?variant=31862710173794).


## Getting started

To check out the site, clone the repo to your local machine and navigate to the directory before running the following commands in the terminal:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once that is run, navigate to http://localhost:3000


## Style guide

This web application is styled using SCSS. Files are located in the e-commerce-prototype/src/styles/ subdirectory.
